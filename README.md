# adf.vin

The Auto Lead Data Format (ADF) is a standard for describing the information needed by a car dealer to provide a customer with a quote for a vehicle and related products or services. The ADF standard was developed by a consortium of companies in the automotive retail space, and this ultra-lightweight library provides a simple way to generate ADF XML documents.

## Example

```javascript
fetch(
	'https://adf.vin/api?' +
		`created=${new Date().toISOString()}&` +
		'firstName=John&' +
		'lastName=Doe&' +
		'email=john.doe%40example.com&' +
		'phone=%2B15555555555&' +
		'year=2018&' +
		'make=Ford&' +
		'model=F-150&' +
		'trim=XL'
)
	.then((response) => response.text())
	.then((xml) => console.log(xml));
```
